# PetsGO Maze Walk

A simple AutoHotkey (AHK) script designed to alternate between clicking in a defined area and walking your character around to break items and collect them.

## Features
- **Click and Walk Cycle:** Break items by clicking in a specific area, then walk your character around to collect the items.
- **Customizable Click Area:** Default area is based on a 1920x1080 resolution with the window positioned at the top-left (aligned up and right). You can modify the coordinates to fit your screen, and the click area will be visible as a faint rectangle.
- **Hotkey Controls:**
  - `F7`: Start the script
  - `F6`: Pause (pauses after the current loop is finished)
  - `F8`: Stop the script

## Customization
- **Adjust Click Area:** Modify the X and Y coordinates within the script to customize where the clicking happens on your screen.
- **Modify Walking Behavior:** The walking pattern is customizable. You can adjust the movement directions and timings based on your preferences.

## Future Features
- Keep background accounts alive while running.
- Automatically resize the window upon start.

## Acknowledgments
This script is based on found code and was further improved with assistance from ChatGPT.
