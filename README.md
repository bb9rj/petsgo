# 🐾 PetsGO Maze Walk

A simple AutoHotkey (AHK) script designed to alternate between clicking in a defined area to break items and walking your character around to collect them.

## ✨ Features
 **Click and Walk Cycle**  
 Break items by clicking in a specific area, then walk your character around to collect the items.

 **Customizable Click Area**  
 Default area is based on a 1920x1080 resolution with the window positioned at the top-left (aligned using Windows key and arrow keys). You can modify the coordinates to fit your window size. The click area will be visible as a faint rectangle.

 **Multi-account**  
 The script will cycle through your Roblox windows and click to prevent disconnects.

**Hotkey Controls**  
`F7`: Start the script  
`F6`: Pause (pauses after the current loops are finished)  
`F8`: Stop the script

## 🤔 How to Use
- Stand in a wide open area.
- Make sure to stay away from the trading plaza teleport.
- Avoid standing near gamepass signs to prevent misclicks.
- Position your camera directly overhead and zoom out.

## 🛠️ Customization
 **Adjust Click Area**  
 Modify the X and Y coordinates within the script to customize where the clicking happens on your screen.  
 
 **Modify Walking Behavior**  
 The walking pattern is customizable. You can adjust the movement directions and timings based on your preferences.
