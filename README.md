# PetsGO Maze Walk

A simple AutoHotkey (AHK) script designed to alternate between clicking in a defined area to break items and walking your character around to collect them.

## Features
- **Click and Walk Cycle:** Break items by clicking in a specific area. Walk your character around to collect the items.
- **Customizable Click Area:** Default area is based on a 1920x1080 resolution with the window positioned at the top-left (aligned up and right with windows key and arrows). You can modify the coordinates to fit your window wize. The click area will be visible as a faint rectangle.
- - **Multiaccount** Script will cycle your Roblox windows and click to prevent disconnects.
- 
- **Hotkey Controls:**
  - `F7`: Start the script
  - `F6`: Pause (pauses after the current loops are finished)
  - `F8`: Stop the script
 
- **How to:** 
– Stand in a wide open area.
– Be sure to stand away from the trading plaza teleport.
– Also don't stand near the gamepass signs to prevent misclicks.
– Position your camera directly overhead and zoom out.


## Customization
- **Adjust Click Area:** Modify the X and Y coordinates within the script to customize where the clicking happens on your screen.
- **Modify Walking Behavior:** The walking pattern is customizable. You can adjust the movement directions and timings based on your preferences.
