# Readme

A simple ahk script that cycles between clicking in a defined area and walking your character around. Designed to break items, then walk around and collect them.

Press F7 to start, F6 to pause (will pause after loops are finished), and F8 to stop.

Default click area is based on 1920x1080 resolution with window moved to the top left with <windows key> up, <windows key> right.

You can set your own click area by modifying the coordinates. The click area will be visible as a faint rectangle drawn on your screen.

Based on found code and modified with help from chatgpt
